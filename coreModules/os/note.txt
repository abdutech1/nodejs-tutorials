Node.js OS

The os module in Node.js provides operating system-related utility methods and properties. It helps retrieve system information such as CPU details, memory usage, and network interfaces, enabling you to write system-aware applications.

It provides functions to interact with the operating system. It provides the hostname of the operating system and returns the amount of free system memory in bytes. 

os.arch(): Returns the CPU architecture of the operating system (e.g., ‘x64’, ‘arm’).
os.cpus(): Provides an array of objects describing each CPU/core installed.
os.freemem(): Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes.
os.homedir(): Returns the path to the current user’s home directory.
os.hostname(): Returns the hostname of the operating system.
os.networkInterfaces(): Returns a list of network interfaces and their details.
os.platform(): Returns the operating system platform (e.g., ‘linux’, ‘darwin’).
os.release(): Returns the operating system release.
os.totalmem(): Returns the total amount of system memory in bytes.
os.uptime(): Returns the system uptime in seconds.

Features
System Information: Provides insights into the system’s hardware and software environment.
Resource Monitoring: Helps in monitoring memory usage and system performance.
Platform Detection: Identifies the platform and version of the operating system.

Example: App.js

Benefits
Enhanced Functionality: Facilitates writing system-specific code.
Performance: Allows monitoring and optimizing system resource usage.
Cross-Platform Support: Ensures compatibility across different operating systems.
Summary
The os module in Node.js is a powerful tool for accessing and managing system information. It enables developers to create applications that are aware of the operating system’s characteristics, improving functionality and performance.
